Following are the important differences between BFS and DFS.

1.	Definition
		BFS, stands for Breadth First Search.
		DFS, stands for Depth First Search.

2.	Data structure
	BFS uses Queue to find the shortest path.
	DFS uses Stack to find the shortest path.

3.	Source
	BFS is better when target is closer to Source.
	DFS is better when target is far from source.

4.	Suitability for decision tree
	As BFS considers all neighbor so it is not suitable for decision tree used in puzzle games.
	DFS is more suitable for decision tree. As with one decision, we need to traverse further to augment the decision.
		If we reach the conclusion, we won.

5.	Speed
	BFS is slower than DFS.
	DFS is faster than BFS.

6.	Time Complexity
	BFS = O(V+E) where V is vertices and E is edges.
	DFS = O(V+E) where V is vertices and E is edges.
